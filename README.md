## Hardware

I've used a Raspberry Pi 2, but a Pi 3 or 4 should also work. 

The LC-Display is a 5 inch resistive touchscreen, which can be bought for around 25$ form [ebay](https://www.ebay.at/itm/5-Inch-800x480-HDMI-Touch-LCD-Screen-Display-For-Raspberry-Pi-3-Pi2-Model-B-A/201703903207) or [amazon](https://www.amazon.de/Resistive-Touch-Screen-Display-interface/dp/B071CKFTJH/). 

The fours buttons are 12mm types, [ebay](https://www.ebay.at/itm/Mini-12mm-wasserdicht-Momentan-ON-OFF-Push-Button-runden-SchaRSDE/312865346056) is also your friend here, but any electronic component supplier has those. 

## Software

The raspberry can use the touchscreen more or less natively. If you're unsure about how to setup up your pi, use this [insctructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/id/Setting-Up-an-800X400-5inch-HDMI-LCD-for-Raspberry/).
